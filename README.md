<h3>motive:</h3><br/>
approach for enhancing library book logs management
through the integration of face recognition technology using the Single Shot MultiBox
Detector (SSD) method. In modern libraries, efficient management of borrowed and
returned books is crucial. The proposed system leverages the SSD algorithm to accurately
detect and locate faces in real-time. By associating these faces with library users' profiles, the system enables streamlined book transactions. Data is securely saved into the
MonogoDB cloud as logs and book can be recorded through Bar-Code.
